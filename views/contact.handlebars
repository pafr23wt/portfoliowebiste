    <h1 class="about-title">About</h1>
    <p>I'm currently in my second year of studying Graphic Design and Web
      Development, with a strong passion for the visual side of things. I
      specialize in using Adobe programs like Illustrator, InDesign, and
      Photoshop, and I love bringing ideas to life with Figma through website
      prototypes. My knowledge extends to Visual Studio Code, HTML5, JavaScript,
      and CSS, giving me a deeper understanding of how websites are constructed.
      This blend of design and technical skills allows me to create not just
      visually stunning prototypes but also ones that are grounded in practical
      web development. Creativity is at the heart of everything I do, I always
      aim to create work that is not only visually striking but also functional
      and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>
